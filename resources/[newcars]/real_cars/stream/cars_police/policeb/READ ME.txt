!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!
If you are feeling generious today, I always will welcome small donations.
It is no way required, but any ammount if you do choose to donate will be 
more then greatly appreciated!

TO GET THE LIGHTS TO WORK PROPERLY ON THIS MODEL, YOU MUST MUST MUST
INSTALL THE CARVARITAIONS LINE INCLUDED WITH THIS FILE. IT WILL MAKE THE
POLICEB ACT LIKE POLICE WITH THE WAY THE LIGHTS FLASH.

If you know anything about siren settings, just change the policeb to 1.

DO NOT MESSAGE ME ABOUT YOUR LIGHTS BEING DIM, AS YOU CAN SEE BY THE SCREENS, 
THEY ARE WELL ENOUGH BRIGHT. ENSURE YOU ARE USING RADIANCE V AND YOUR POST FX
AND YOUR SHADER QUALITY ARE SET TO MAX.  

I will not give support to a question that has already been answered, please 
read through the comments section or this read me, as it is here for a reason.

=============== Instillation ===============
To install the Harley, all you have to do is navigate to the latest patch day
you have in your MODS folder, and place it in the vehicles.rpf there.

For me it would be:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\mods\update\x64\dlcpacks\patchday9ng\dlc.rpf\x64\levels\gta5\vehicles.rpf\

To install the CARVAR file, navigate to:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\Mods\update\x64\dlcpacks\mpvalentines2\dlc.rpf\common\data
and Install the line into the carvariation there!

=============== NOTES =============== 
A lot of work has gone into this bike, it has been a long time in the making 
and I would just like to thank the guys over at Code Zero gaming, more specifically
Polecat324 and BayAreaBugs, for giving me the oportunity to do these bikes.

This bike is part of a CHP mega pack that I will be releasing at the earliest time it is done.
The pack includes: - 2016 Utility
                   - 2013 Marked and slicktop utility
                   - 2013 Ford F2/350
                   - 2011 CVPI, vector and Liberty
                   - 2010 Dodge Charger
                   and whatever else i can find pictures of!

It took a long time to do because the base model that was crunched was about 
1.4 MILLION triangles, so it was quite the project. 

I always thought that pay walls were fucking stupid, so a huge thanks to the guys at code zero for
rendering the current one on the harley in the community obsolite, and this bike is also of better 
quality.

The model itself is quite large in megabyte size, but it should not be an issue with anyone's
game as the PoliceB does not spawn on a reoccuring basis.

Once again as i've stated, YOU MUST INSTALL THE CARVAR LINE BEFORE USING THE BIKE!

There should be no problems with the bike itself, it should act exactly like the default policeb. 
If you have any issues, make sure to leave a comment or PM me!

This model is after the California Highway Patrol, so it has a steadyburn and their lights they use
on the bike itself.

There is a template included with the file itself, so you are able to make your own skins for the bike.

The DEV versions of this bike will be released later next month.

I will be releasing a LAPD version with their gun mounts on it later next week.

If you encounter any bugs, feel free to message me!
